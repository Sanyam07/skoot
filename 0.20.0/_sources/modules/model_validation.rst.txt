==============================
The model validation submodule
==============================

The model validation submodule is designed to offer model monitoring classes
that can be stacked after transformers to warn or raise when test variable
distributions stray too far from the expected range. This can be very useful
for situations where covariate shift is a real threat and needs to be detected
within a reasonably quick timeframe.
